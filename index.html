<h1>It's dead, Jim</h1>

<p>This was an extremely old website I made when I knew pretty much nothing about programming. I like to think I've come a long way since then.</p>

<p>My website <a href="https://thetechrobo.ca">thetechrobo.ca</a> has since replaced it. Please go there instead, I beg of you.</p>

<p>Existing links should continue to function.</p>
