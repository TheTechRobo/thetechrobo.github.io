# It's dead, Jim
This was an extremely old website I made when I knew pretty much nothing about programming. I like to think I've come a long way since then.

My website https://thetechrobo.ca has since replaced it.

If you were going to a https://thetechrobo.github.io link, 
you should have been automatically redirected with JavaScript, but if you don't have that turned on,
going to `https://thetechrobo.ca/thetechrobo.github.io/<whatever link you have>` should work fine.
